🧍‍♂️ Biography ---Cheng Hangbei (成航北)

I am a master's student (Class of 2023) at [School of CCST](https://ccst.tyut.edu.cn/), [Taiyuan University of Technology (TYUT)](https://www.tyut.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [**Associate Professor Wu Yongfei**](https://tylgswyxgc.tyut.edu.cn/info/1411/5135.htm). I am a member of the [TYUT Intelligent Medicine and Biometric Laboratory (IMBR)](https://lab.rjmart.cn/10579/3146DDB7959849F4), and my research primarily focuses on intelligent analysis of medical images, with key interests in:

-  **Intelligent Lesion Segmentation in Pathological Images** 
-  **Segmentation of Incompletely or Imprecisely Labeled Medical Images** 
-  **Research and Applications of Large Medical Vision Models** 

Additionally, I have experience in **federated learning security defenses** and **face anti-spoofing**, particularly in their applications for medical privacy protection and biometric recognition. 
Recently, I have been interested in the application of **embodied intelligence in the medical field** and am actively exploring ways to advance the integration of intelligent medical imaging into clinical practice.

If you are interested in my research or potential collaborations, feel free to contact me via the provided details!

[GLMKD: Joint Global and Local Mutual Knowledge Distillation for Weakly Supervised Lesion Seg‑mentation in Histopathology Images] 

Expert Systems with Applications（SCI‑1区 TOP） 1st revision

**Hangbei Cheng**, Xueyu Liu, Jun Zhang, Xiaorong Dong, Xuetao Ma, Yansong Zhang, Hao Meng, Xing Chen, Guanghui Yue, Yidi Li, Yongfei Wu,∗

[Paper] | [[**Code**]]([https://github.com/chenghangbei0702/GLMKD-WSSS]) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

**Highlights**
- A novel weakly-supervised segmentation framework is proposed to enhance lesion delineation in digital pathology images by integrating global and local information.
- This study is the first to combine global supervisory information and multi-scale MIL via dual-stream knowledge distillation in a WSSS framework.
- A multi-scale multi-instance learning model (MMIL) is designed to capture subtle variations in lesions across different scales.
- A shape transfer loss function is introduced to facilitate effective information exchange between global and local contexts during the dual-flow mutual knowledge distillation (MKD) segmentation phase.

[FMaMIL: FFT enchanced vision Mamba Multi-instance learning for Weakly Supervised Lesion Segmentation in Medical Images] 

IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology（SCI‑1区 TOP \ CCF-B类期刊） With editor

[Paper] | [[**Code**]]([https://github.com/chenghangbei0702/MambaMIL]) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

**Highlights**
- We propose a novel MIL framework with linear computational complexity, effectively integrating spatial and frequency-domain features to comprehensively capture inter-instance correlations. To our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate both Mamba and frequencydomain information into MIL.
- We design a learnable frequency-domain feature encoding approach based on Fourier transform and inverse transform. By employing parameterized frequency-domain weights for feature transformation, this method replaces traditional handcrafted filtering approaches, significantly enhancing the model’s expressive capacity.
- We extend the application of bidirectional scanning methods to two-dimensional space, improving Mamba’s ability to understand contextual information in pathological images. Additionally, we integrate a multi-head attentionbased instance-to-bag classifier, further boosting segmentation performance in lesion identification tasks.
