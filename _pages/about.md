## üîç Research Interests

My current research focuses on **vision modeling and learning with limited annotations** in medical image scenarios. Specifically:

- **Weakly Supervised & Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation**  
  ‚Üí Multi-scale lesion feature learning, label noise robustness, shape prior modeling.

- **Multi-modal Prompt Engineering & Visual Foundation Models**  
  ‚Üí Leveraging large-scale models (e.g., CLIP, SAM) for domain adaptation, semantic alignment, and efficient transfer to medical domains.

- **Embodied Intelligence & Multi-agent Collaboration in Medical AI (Exploratory)**  
  ‚Üí Modeling decision-making and robustness in multi-agent, multi-modal diagnostic systems.

> *My long-term vision is to design intelligent, trustworthy, and interpretable visual systems that can truly ‚Äúsee and understand‚Äù the world, not just recognize pixels.*

## üß≠ PhD Motivation & Direction

> ‚ÄúÊÑø‰∏ìÊ≥®ËßÜËßâÁêÜËß£ÔºåÂÅöÁúüÊ≠£ÁúãÂæóÊáÇ‰∏ñÁïåÁöÑÊ®°ÂûãÔºå‰πüÂÅöÂÄºÂæóË¢´ËÆ∞‰ΩèÁöÑÊàêÊûú„ÄÇ‚Äù

During my master's, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in medical image modeling, weakly-supervised learning, and large vision model tuning. I aim to further explore **explainable, robust and adaptive vision systems** for complex real-world environments.  
In the PhD phase, I hope to:

- Delve into **multimodal and embodied perception**
- Address trustworthiness and generalization in medical AI
- Bridge model-level innovation and real-world application

If you're a professor or lab PI working in related areas, I'm very open to potential collaborations!
